         * Normally, the server determines if a player is picking up a dropped item
         * by checking if the bounding boxes of the player and the item intersect.
         *
         * This can be simplified: for each direction (X, Y, Z), check if the distance between the centers of the bounding boxes
         * is lower than the sum of the radius (half the length) of each box.
         *
         * If the condition is satisfied for all directions, the bounding boxes intersect. Visual example:
         *
         *     Box #1
         * ._____________.
         * |             |
         * |             |   Box #2
         * |      *  .___|_______________.

         * |_________|___|     *         |
         *           |                   |
         *           |___________________|
         *
         *        *------>
         *        Radius #1
         *
         *           <---------*
         *             Radius #2
         *
         *        *------------*
         *   Distance between centers
         *
         *
         * In the example above, the distance between the centers is lower than the sum of the two radii,
         * so the boxes collide in that direction.
